> Iterative journalism is the idea of adjusting coverage in real time to serve the rapidly changing information needs of readers. This is possible by mixing editorial insights with audience feedback. Knowing which issues readers care about helps journalists to be accountable to them. The iterative process starts with defining opportunities for news experimentation and identifying both the editorial resources needed and technical requirements. After launching a story prototype and measuring its audience impact, journalists evaluate whether the effort warrants additional commitment. If so, they can develop a scaling strategy, handing off the project to the proper group for the day-today management. Implementing “minimally viable” stories, pursuing augmented audience understanding, and setting up research and development labs are three distinct strategies of iterative journalism that allow newsrooms to understand what variables of a story are most relevant to news consumers.
